    question: "How does NAMEE3 work?",
    answer: (
      <p>
        NAMEE3 leverages the power of blockchain technology to provide
        decentralized domain names. By registering a domain on the Fantom
        blockchain, you gain full control and ownership of your digital
        identity. This eliminates reliance on central authorities and enhances
        security and resilience.
